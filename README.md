Emerald
=======

Emerald is a responsive grid system written in LESS

Warning
-------
**This project is not ready for a (general) production use!**
Versions `0.0.x` follow my specific goal. Expect more generalization and
documentation in future versions.

How to use
----------
It is advised to include the LESS files in your project and compile it with your build sript.

If you need (or realy want) the CSS make sure you have node and npm.
Than install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```
The CSS is generated simply by running:
```
$ grunt
```

The name
-------
Please not that the name *Emerald* does not reffer to the gemstone of that name but to a [diamond cut](http://www.lumeradiamonds.com/diamond-education/emerald-cut-diamond) "originally developed for the cutting of emeralds."

Does it really matter? No.
