# Emerald

Emerald is a responsive grid system written in LESS

* Responsive
* OOCSS
* BEM sytax
* Nestable
* Mobile-first
* Tablet-come-from
* Block-element based
* (= no floats, clears or rows)
* Configurable

## Warning
**This project is not ready for a (general) production use!**

Versions `0.x.x` follow my specific goal. Expect more generalization and documentation in future versions.

## How to use
It is advised to include the LESS files in your project and compile it with your build script.

If you need (or really want) the CSS use the one in the `css/` folder or build it with `$ grunt`.

## The name
Please not that the name *Emerald* does not refer to the gemstone of that name but to a [diamond cut](http://www.lumeradiamonds.com/diamond-education/emerald-cut-diamond) "originally developed for the cutting of emeralds."

Does it really matter? No.
